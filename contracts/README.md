# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

To verify smart contract on-chain

```shell
npm run verify mumbai <deployed_contract_address> 0xA02f6adc7926efeBBd59Fd43A84f4E0c0c91e832 20
# currently only for mumbai testnet
```
